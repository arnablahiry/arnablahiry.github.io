   Force theme-related property transitions to be instantaneous on the
   repositories page even when the transient .theme-animate class is present.
   This ensures the page flips immediately while other pages (eg. home)
   may animate during a user-initiated toggle.

   keyframes, motion) remain unaffected. Use !important to override
